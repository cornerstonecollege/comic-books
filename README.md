### How to use ComixGram

ComixGram is an app meant for iOS devices that transforms any image into a comic-like photo. Pick an image from your gallery or use your iPhone's built-in camera to take a new picture and apply filters to the chosen image. You have many options of how to customize your picures such as inserting and rotate speech bubbles, sound effects, change colours and other. Locate the filter options at the bottom of the screen and, with a single touch, choose the desired filter. You might as well scroll right and left to locate more filters. Each filter contains certain values in order to adapt better to high and low definition images. Effects contain cartoon and comic book alike pictures.
